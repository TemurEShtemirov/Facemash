Welcome to Real-time Face Detection application! This project utilizes TensorFlow.js to perform real-time face detection using the Facemesh model. It provides an interactive interface to detect faces in live webcam streams.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow.js**: Used for machine learning-based face detection.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **React Webcam**: Library for accessing the webcam in React applications.
- **CSS**: Styling to enhance the visual appearance.
- **HTML Canvas**: Utilized for drawing face detection results.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using the Facemesh model.
- Interactive interface with live webcam stream.
- User-friendly design with React components.
- Works in modern web browsers.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection.git](https://github.com/TemurEShtemirov/Facemash.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd face-detection
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Grant Webcam Access**:
   When prompted, allow the application to access your webcam.

5. **Interact with the Application**:
   Experience real-time face detection by observing the bounding boxes around detected faces in the webcam stream.
